# MIRRORTREE 

This is the PYT and SBI project developed by [**Elba Raimúndez**](https://github.com/elbaraim), [**Clàudia Fontserè**](https://github.com/claudefa) and **Lucas Michel**. 

##What is mirrorTree
**mirrorTree** is a program to predict protein-protein interaction using similarity between two protein families (Pazos and Valencia, 2001).

##Why two versions
**mirrorTree** has two versions:
- [**Mirror_Tree_v1**](https://github.com/claudefa/PythonProject/tree/master/Mirror_Tree_v1): Inside the directory the user can find mirrorTree 1.0. 
- [**MirrorTree_v2_beta**](https://github.com/claudefa/PythonProject/tree/master/MirrorTree_v2_beta): This is mirrorTree 2.0 with visual interface. It is still in beta.

##How to install
We recommend to install and execute MirrorTree 1.0.
MirrorTree 2.0 is still in development but the user may want to try it as well. 
To properly install each package, enter the corresponding directory and read carefully the README. 

Thanks for using mirrorTree! :)
